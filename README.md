This repository includes my disseration's documents meaning the pdf and python notebooks.
The title of the dissertation is "Dynamic Demand Fore-casting and Optimization: Improving the Management of Crisis-Driven Food Supply Chains" and
it was a part of the postgraduate program in Data Science from the International Hellenic University at Thessaloniki, Greece.
Basically, it bridges bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, providing value to individuals and organizations.
It was conducted a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review to identify machine learning methods for food demand forecasting and
EOQ techniques tailored to crisis-driven food supply chains. Using the Kaggle dataset “Food Demand Forecasting,” an XGBoost model was employed to predict
the last ten weeks of meal orders. These predictions, along with other parameters, served as inputs for a Linear Programming (LP) model designed to optimize
order quantities under constraints such as budget and warehouse capacity. To enhance understanding, a budg-et reduction sensitivity analysis and
demand variation simulation were performed to evaluate the impact of changing parameters or data. Finally, a user-friendly web appli-cation was developed,
integrating the forecasting algorithm and LP model, offering a dynamic and interactive interface suitable for both technical and non-technical users.
