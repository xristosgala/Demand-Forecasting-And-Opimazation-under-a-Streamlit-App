# Dynamic Demand Forecasting and Optimization: Improving the Management of Crisis-Driven Food Supply Chains

This repository was created to include the thesis documents. Specifically, the disseration was a mandatory part of the Masters in Data Science from the Internation Hellenic University in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The repository includes the following:
- **Christos Galanis Thesis.pdf:** This is the final version of the thesis. It includes all the information in detail for an appropriate comprehension of the research.
- **Food Demand Forecasting.ipynb:** contains EDA part and three different approaches using the XGBoost model for food order prediction
- **Linear Programming:** includes the results of the best XGBoost model approach while these results are given as input to an LP algorithm for determing the optimal number of food orders under various constraints.
- **Streamlit App:** contains the approaches from the two previous files adjusting them appropriate for the the streamlit application.
